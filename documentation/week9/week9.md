## Process

Another successful week! Here's the updated demo. It's not currently live as literally none of the kinks have been sorted out, but hey - it serves as a nice proof of concept.

Here, I am testing the possibility of not having the camera be visible on the canvas. In terms of SketchUp, this simulates a possible interaction within the SketchUp application. It's not perfect - because the laptop camera is front-facing, it is inverted and therefore doesn't provide a direct one to one connection to the user motion. 

We are still in the process of deciding which kind of interaction is best in terms of whether the cube on screen should mirror the physical motion or if the cube should mimic the motion.

## Next Steps



### Goals for Next Week

- Test camera inversion on an opaque background.
- Create a cube in Blender that matches the letter rotation on the cube to make the experience more immersive.
- Try to host the AR.js library locally.
- Make the UX prototype fully clickable? This one actually requires quite a bit of work in terms of recreating the SketchUp browser version in figma instead of using a static picture to simulate the background.
